## Bioinformatics Services and Consulting

Labs and biotech companies are often overwhelmed by the sheer volume of genomic, proteomic, and transcriptomic data. A bioinformatics consultant provides the specialized bridge between raw biological samples and actionable insights. Whether you need accuracy benchmarking, customization or PhD-level bioinformatics expertise but aren't ready for a $180k/year full-time hire, I bridge that talent gap.

I provide practical bioinformatics support, including:

- RNA-seq, genomic, and metagenomic data analysis
