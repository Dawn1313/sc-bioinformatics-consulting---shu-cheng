# SC Bioinformatics Consulting - Shu Cheng 
## Bioinformatics Services and Consulting

I support academic, public health, and biotech teams in translating biological big data into clear, reproducible results —— genomics and transcriptomics, with the goal to advance our understanding of biology and human health, driving innovation in biomedical research and improving public health outcomes.

Connecting bioinformatics with art is my ideal. I am always inspired by the beauty in nature and in art. My dad was very talented in calligraphy and painting. I aim to convert an ocean of data, DNA/RNA sequence reads and associated metadata, into biologically meaningful, statistically significant results, in an interesting, beautiful way. 


## What I Do

I provide practical bioinformatics support, including:

- RNA-seq, genomic, and metagenomic data analysis  

- Data quality control and troubleshooting  

- Custom, reproducible pipelines (Nextflow)  

- Exploratory analysis and visualization  

- Analysis documentation and methods support  


## About Me

I am an independent bioinformatics consultant with abundant experience supporting bioinformatics projects from raw data to publication-ready results.

I value tailored bioinformatics workflows, reproducibility, and efficient problem-solving.
